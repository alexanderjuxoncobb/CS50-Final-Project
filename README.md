# CS50-Final-Project
A webapp that scrapes the internet to make an informed decision on who will win an upcoming football match in the premier league.

I parse information from sources such as the current table rankings alongside recent BBC articles and YouTube comments for the two teams selected. This is then sent to the OpenAI API, which returns the match date, who is playing at home, the predicted winner and 3 reasons for making this prediction.
